# Jokester API
For my final project at Flatiron School, I created a Jokester application. You will be able to view different jokes, add a new joke, and delete a joke. You can learn more about the reasoning behind the creation of the app by clicking the "about" page. 

## Installation

1. Download this repository
2. open up terminal
    1. run `bundle`
    2. run `rails db:create`
    3. run `rails db:migrate`
    4. run `rails s` to start backend server on localhost:3000
3. click link to frontend repository and download instructions: https://github.com/riannacastro/joke-frontend


## Usage

Once you followed the steps above and have the server running, you can go to localhost:3000/jokes to view data.

To view the JSON objects easily, I would recommend downloading a chrome extension.
